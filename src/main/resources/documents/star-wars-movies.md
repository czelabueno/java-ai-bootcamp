# How to Watch Every Star Wars Movie and Series in Order

## 1. The Acolyte
Chronologically, The Acolyte is the earliest part of the Star Wars timeline that you can watch. Set at the end of the High Republic era, long before the Skywalker Saga kicks off, this Disney+ series follows a young former Jedi named Osha (played by Amandla Stenberg) who works with her old Master, Sol (played by Lee Jung-jae) to investigate the murder of another Jedi

## 2. Episode I: The Phantom Menace
Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace explored what happened long before the original trilogy, making it the starting point for a chronological watch. It introduced us to a young Anakin Skywalker (played by Jake Lloyd) who would hopefully be the one to bring balance to the force. 

## 3. Episode II: Attack of clones
The second installment of the prequel trilogy, which came out only a few years after its predecessor in 2002, is the next stop in a chronological watch. Taking place ten years after Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, it centers on an older Anakin (played now by Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan (played once again by Ewan McGregor) as they discover new and terrifying threats in the galaxy, which in turn leads up to the Clone Wars.

## 4. Star Wars: Clone Wars (Animated Series)
Clone Wars is a 2D animated series that ran on Cartoon Network from 2003-2005 and explored what happened during the titular wars, making it the perfect story to slot in between Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones and Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. Anakin and Obi-Wan returned as characters as well, but were voiced by different people (Mat Lucas and James Arnold Taylor, respectively). Even though this series came to an end in 2005, the Clone Wars stories continued with a movie and new series in 2008.

## 5. Episode III: Revenge of the Sith
The third and final installment in the prequel trilogy was Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, which released in 2005. Following all of the thrills from The Clone Wars, this film takes place three years after Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones and sees a major shift in Anakin, eventually bringing the prequel trilogy of the Skywalker Saga to a close. And while Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope starts up a new chapter of that Saga, there are plenty of stories still to explore in the time between in this galaxy far, far away.

## 6. Solo: A Star Wars Story
In the time before the original trilogy of the Skywalker Saga, there’s a film that details the origin of one of its most important characters: Han Solo. Solo: A Star Wars Story is set 10 years before the events of Stars Wars Episode IV: A New Hope and starred Alden Ehrenreich as the titular smuggler, following him and Chewbacca on an adventurous heist. He’s not the only character we get a bit of backstory on before the original trilogy, though.

## 7. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Series)
Obi-Wan Kenobi is a mini series that was released in 2022 and follows the titular Jedi 10 years after the events of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, with Ewan McGregor returning to the role.

## 8. Star Wars: Rebels (Animated Series)
Also taking place a little over 10 years after Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, and five years before Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Star Wars Rebels is an animated series that follows the Rebellion’s small beginnings in a galaxy far, far away. It ran for four seasons with 75 total episodes, so you’ll have plenty to keep you occupied as you follow the stories about the rise of the Rebellion.

## 9. Star Wars: Andor (Series)
Similar to Star Wars Rebels and also taking place five years before Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Star Wars: Andor follows the formation of the Rebel Alliance, with Cassian Andor (played by Diego Luna) leading the series.

## 10. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is set just before the events of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope and follows a group of Rebels, Cassian included, as they plot to steal the plans for the Death Star. This film was the first of the standalone Star Wars spin-offs and featured a stellar cast alongside Luna, including Felicity Jones, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Mads Mikkelsen, and many more.

## 11. Episode IV: A New Hope
And all of these events finally lead us into the trilogy that started it all, and the next chronological chapter of the Skywalker Saga. Released in 1977, Stars Wars Episode IV: A New Hope centered on Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) as he begins Jedi training under Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and sets out on a journey to rescue Rebel Alliance leader Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) with the help of smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). It’s an incredible classic that started this whole journey in the first place, and chronologically will set you up right in the middle of your Star Wars journey.

## 12. Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back
Star Wars came back bigger and better with Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. Set three years after its predecessor, this film follows our favorite Rebels as they continue to fight back against Imperial forces, and as Luke begins training with Yoda. It also sees Darth Vader reaching out to Luke in an attempt to lure him to the Dark Side. It’s dramatic, action-packed, and sure to keep you invested as you jump into the final film of the original trilogy.

## 13. Episode VI: Return of the Jedi
Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi brings the original trilogy’s Skywalker Saga to a close. Set one year after the events of Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, this story revolves around the Rebel fleet as they aim to take down the newly-rebuilt Death Star. It’s a climactic finale that also sees Luke confronting Darth Vader once more, tieing up remaining strings as the Rebels make their final assault. It’s a film that leaves the fate of the galaxy in new hands, and open for new stories.

## 14. Star Wars: The Mandalorian (Series)
In the time between the fall of the Empire and the rise of the First Order, there are several stories to appear - and one of the most exciting comes from Star Wars: The Mandalorian. This space western is a series running on Disney+ that instantly won over fans with its exciting story of a bounty hunter named Din Djarin (played by Pedro Pascal) and his adventures with little Grogu.

## 15. Star Wars: The Book of Boba Fett (Series)
A familiar name to many Star Wars fans, Boba Fett (played by Temuera Morrison, who also appeared in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones as Jango Fett and re-recorded lines for Boba in the DVD re-release of the original trilogy) is another bounty hunter who roams the galaxy. Serving as a spin-off of Star Wars: The Mandalorian, and set around the same period of time, The Book of Boba Fett follows the titular character as he leaves the life of a bounty hunter behind to take over the territory formerly run by Jabba the Hut. It currently only has one season out with seven episodes that run almost an hour each.

## 16. Star Wars: Ahsoka (Series)
Ahsoka centers on the titular former Jedi Knight as she investigates an emerging threat to the galaxy. And for those who have been wondering where the show fits on the timeline, we have some potential answers. In an interview with SFX magazine (via GamesRadar) Sabine Wren's actress Natasha Liu Bordizzo stated that, "Ahsoka runs along the same timeline as The Mandalorian season 3, and the shows are all connected. There's just so many parallels.

## 17. Skeleton Crew (Series)
Star Wars: Skeleton Crew "is set concurrently with The Mandalorian and Ahsoka," according to Empire Magazine (via Screen Rant). The Goonies-inspird series follows a group of ordinary suburban kids from the planet At Attin who find themselves mixed up in a space-pirate adventure. Jude Law stars as Jod Na Nawood.

## 18. Episode VII: The Force Awakens
The sequel trilogy kicked off with Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens, which introduced us to a brand new band of Rebels. At the center of these films was Rey (played by Daisy Ridley), who joins up with ex-Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega), Resistance pilot Poe (played by Oscar Isaac), and our beloved smuggler Han Solo (played once again by Harrison Ford) as they work with the Resistance (led by Carrie Fisher’s General Leia Organa) to track down Luke Skywalker (once again played by Mark Hamill) and take down the First Order, with Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver) as the film’s main antagonist. It’s a reunion of old and new that started the sequel trilogy off with a bang.

## 19. Episode VIII: The Last Jedi
The search for Luke Skywalker leads straight into Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi. Kicking off immediately after the end of The Force Awakens, this story follows Rey as she seeks to recruit Luke’s help. Given the First Order’s relentless pursuits, The Resistance could use it, but she’s not the only one out looking for ways to gain the upper hand. Finn gets help from a mechanic named Rose Tico (played by Kelly Marie Tran) and the two work together to help Resistance members escape the First Order. This film also serves as the farewell to Carrie Fisher, and was lovingly dedicated to her at the end.

## 20. Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker
The final installment of the sequel trilogy, and grand finale of the Skywalker Saga in general, sees our crew of Resistance fighters take their final stand against Kylo Ren and the First Order. However, the First Order isn’t working alone, as Emperor Palpatine makes his return to aid them. Unfortunately, this film wasn’t a massive success amongst critics. Our own reviewer called it “a film engineered to hit the viewer on multiple levels while struggling to settle 42 years’ worth of story elements.
